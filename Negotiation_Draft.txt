DRAFT EMAIL
Subject: Proposed Revisions - Service Agreement
Dear Vendor Team,
Thank you for sending over the draft agreement. We have completed our internal review and identified a few areas where the terms do not align with our standard corporate policy.
We have attached the redlined agreement with the following key changes:
Payment Terms: Adjusted to Net-30 days to align with our standard accounts payable cycle.
Liability: Increased the cap to a standard commercial level ($10k), as $100 offers insufficient coverage.
Jurisdiction: Updated to Delaware, USA, as we cannot accept jurisdiction in Antarctica.
Please confirm if these changes are acceptable so we can proceed to signature.
Best regards,
Legal Team
