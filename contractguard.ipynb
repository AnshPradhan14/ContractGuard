Email to the Vendor\n\nSubject: Proposed Revisions for Compliance – [Agreement Name/Reference Number]\n\nDear [Vendor Contact Name],\n\nThank you for providing the draft [Agreement Name/Service Agreement/Contract for X] for our review. We appreciate your collaboration on this project.\n\nOur legal team has completed their review of the draft agreement. To ensure full alignment with our corporate policies and regulatory requirements, we've identified a few standard adjustments that need to be made. We aim to finalize this agreement efficiently and smoothly.\n\nPlease find the proposed changes detailed below for your review and consideration:\n\n1.  **Payment Terms:**\n    Our Policy Rule 1 requires payment terms to be Net-30 or Net-45. The current draft specifies Net-90. We propose the following revision:\n    *   **Original:** \"Payment terms shall be Net-90.\"\n    *   **Proposed Revision:** \"Payment terms shall be Net-**30**.\"\n\n2.  **Limitation of Liability:**\n    Our Policy Rule 2 mandates a minimum liability cap of $10,000. The current cap of $100 USD is below this minimum. We propose updating this as follows:\n    *   **Original:** \"The total aggregate liability of [Vendor Name] under this Agreement shall not exceed $100 USD.\"\n    *   **Proposed Revision:** \"The total aggregate liability of [Vendor Name] under this Agreement shall not exceed **$10,000** USD.\"\n\n3.  **Governing Law and Jurisdiction:**\n    Our Policy Rule 3 explicitly disallows Antarctica as a governing jurisdiction. We propose establishing a standard and mutually agreeable jurisdiction:\n    *   **Original:** \"This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of Antarctica.\"\n    *   **Proposed Revision:** \"This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of **the State of Delaware, USA**.\"\n\nWe believe these revisions bring the agreement into compliance with our standard operational policies. Please let us know if these proposed changes are acceptable. We are happy to discuss any of these points further if needed.\n\nWe look forward to your confirmation so we can move forward with the finalization of this agreement.\n\nBest regards,\n\n[Your Name/Legal Department]\nLegal Negotiator\n[Your Company Name]\n[Your Contact Information]\n✅ Saved professional report to: Contract_Review_Report.pdf\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":11},{"cell_type":"code","source":"","metadata":{"trusted":true},"outputs":[],"execution_count":null}]}
